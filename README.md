Project: Building a website for a local plumbing business.

Epic: Creating a comprehensive and user-friendly website for the plumbing business.

User Story 1: As a developer, I want to gather detailed descriptions of all the services offered by the plumbing business so that I can accurately represent them on the website.

User Story 2: As a developer, I want to collect the business owner's certifications, contact information, and social media links so that I can include them on the website for credibility and easy access.

User Story 3: As a developer, I want to understand the business owner's color preferences for the website so that I can design it to align with their brand identity.

User Story 4: As a developer, I want to review the website's progress with the business owner every few days so that I can receive feedback and make necessary adjustments.

User Story 5: As a customer, I want to easily navigate the website and find the information I need so that I can quickly decide to hire the plumbing services.

User Story 6: As a customer, I want to see testimonials and reviews on the website so that I can feel confident in the quality of the services provided.
